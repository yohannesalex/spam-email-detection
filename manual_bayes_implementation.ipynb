    "The **posterior probability** is calculated using Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{Spam | Email}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{Email | Spam})}{P(\\text{Email})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given email, let \\( w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n \\) represent the words in the email. The posterior probability can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{Spam | Email}) \\propto P(\\text{Spam}) \\cdot P(w_1 | \\text{Spam}) \\cdot P(w_2 | \\text{Spam}) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot P(w_n | \\text{Spam})\n",

    "Similarly, the posterior probability for non-spam (ham) is:\n",

    "P(\\text{Ham | Email}) \\propto P(\\text{Ham}) \\cdot P(w_1 | \\text{Ham}) \\cdot P(w_2 | \\text{Ham}) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot P(w_n | \\text{Ham})\n",

    "#### why do i use logarithim?\n",
    "1.  Preventing Underflow:\n",
    "Probabilities are often very small, especially when multiplying many of them together (as in Naive Bayes).\n",
    "Multiplying many small probabilities can lead to underflow, where the result is too small for the computer to represent accurately.\n",
    "Logarithms convert multiplication of probabilities into addition, which avoids this issue.\n",
    "2. Simplifies Multiplication:\n",
    "Instead of multiplying probabilities, we add their logarithms:\n",
    "log(a×b)=log(a)+log(b)\n",
    "This makes the computations more stable and easier to handle, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "3. Better Numerical Stability:\n",
    "Logarithmic operations are less sensitive to numerical precision issues compared to directly working with very small probabilities.\n",
    "4. Efficient Calculation:\n",
    "Adding numbers (logarithms of probabilities) is computationally more efficient than multiplying a long chain of small numbers.\n",
